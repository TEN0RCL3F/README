# INFO

You're free to interact with me or friend request me! Just know that I won't always talk much if I don't know you well, I sometimes tend to get quiet.
I DON'T roleplay, and I am simply cosplaying characters I like.
I will block or hide freely ; it's rarely anything personal, sometimes I'll just want to hide a conversation I don't wanna see!
I won't interact with Valentinos as Angel Dust ; otherwise, it's okay, but please don't be weird.

Please feel free to ask me about my OCs! I'll usually be;

- JIGGY CIPHER ; MLP OC

Jiggy is a Unicorn who works for Twilight as the 'royal cryptanalyist', he's a bit of a grouch and sure knows little about friendship, for admiring Twilight so much.

- YEOP BO-REUM "VIENNA" ; HAZBIN HOTEL OC

Vienna is an OC that was created for a HH roleplay with my friends, in which she replaces Valentino after he gets killed. She's leading hell's tourism scene, making a horrible and endless damnation almost- *almost* feel a little special! Queen of gentrification, out of touch with herself, and VERY suspicious of Vox... Velvette is bae tho!
(AKA, please interact, other Vees!)
